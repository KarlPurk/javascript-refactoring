Refactoring Structure
======================

Each refactoring should contain the following:

- Name 
- Summary
- Motivation
- Mechanics
- Examples
- More Information

Most refactorings will probably start with only a few of these sections.  Other sections can be added at a later date.  At the very least each refactoring should have a name and summary.

# Name
The name of the refactoring should be short, clear and memorable.  It should describe the refactoring at a high level.

#Summary
The summary section should describe, as briefly as possible, the situation the user is in before the refactoring and the result of performing the refactoring.  This section should also include two brief accompanying code examples.

#Motivation
The motivation section should describe the situations where a user should and should not perform the refactoring.

#Mechanics
The mechanics section should describe the steps a user needs to take to perform the refactoring.

#Examples
The examples section should include detailed examples of the refactoring in action.  Multiple examples may be required for refactorings that have multiple implementations.

#More Information
The more information section should list any related resources that may be useful for the user implementing the pattern.
